# PhonebookAPI
Attempt at using .NET Core to produce an API that meets specifications detailed by hackajob. 

My attempt is based on various code sources and how I tried to understand them.

* All endpoints covered (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) - thanks to a tutorial from the Microsoft website.

* Use of an in-memory database to persist data.

* Use of Xunit and Moq to write a unit test and a functional test. The functional test was never detected by Visual Studio.

* Implementation of OAuth authentication was attempted.
